/// of a `.task` file, and a driver's task write is a list of assignments. Leave one out and nothing fails:
/// the parse succeeds, the write succeeds, the push reports success, and the task simply keeps whatever the
/// target project had. `EdgePcTask` migrated out of pro2193 as <c>Freewheeling</c> where its file said
/// <c>Cyclic</c> — a task running flat out instead of on a cycle — because <c>kind_of_task</c> was the one
/// member CODESYS's <c>WriteTask</c> never set. No test could have caught it: the engine hands the driver a
/// complete <c>TaskSettings</c> either way, so every offline double sees a correct call.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Which makes this a gate on the SOURCE, deliberately.</b> It cannot be a behaviour test, because the
/// behaviour is only observable against a live IDE — which is exactly the condition under which a field goes
/// missing for months. So it reads the record's own property list and asks each driver's write path to mention
/// every one of them. Adding a field to <c>TaskSettings</c> without teaching both drivers to write it fails
/// here, on a build agent, with the field's name in the message.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What "mention" means, and why that is enough.</b> A name appearing in the write path does not prove
/// it is written correctly — that is what the live e2e suite and the corpus migration are for. It proves the
/// author SAW the field. Every real instance of this bug has been an omission, never a wrong assignment, and a
/// gate that catches omissions cheaply is worth more than one that catches nothing because it was too hard to
/// write. A field a vendor cannot express is declared below rather than ignored.</para>
