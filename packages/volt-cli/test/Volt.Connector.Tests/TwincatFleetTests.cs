/// THE FLEET LOOP ITSELF — probe → reconcile → spawn/reap, composed.

/// <para><c>TwincatFleet</c>'s own summary says it was lifted out of the WinForms tray so a test project could
/// reach it, "so the fleet rules that actually ran had zero coverage while the suite asserted a spawn plan the
/// tray discarded". The lift happened; the tests did not. Its three ingredients each have their own suite
/// (<see cref="TwincatSupervisorTests"/>, <see cref="TwincatXaeProbeTests"/>, <see cref="ProbeHealthTests"/>) and
/// nothing exercised the loop that ties them together — so "a crashed worker is respawned" and "a closed XAE is
/// reaped" were properties of three parts, never of the whole.</para>
///
/// <para>Real processes, as <see cref="BridgeSupervisorTests"/> does, because the spawn is the point. The probe
/// is the one thing faked: it spawns a COM-isolated subprocess to enumerate XAE windows, which no test can
/// conjure. Windows-only, like the connector.</para>
