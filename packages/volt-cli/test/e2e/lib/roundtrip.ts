 * networks, and a created FBD body is renumbered from `NETWORK 0` to `NETWORK 1` because the vendor assigns its
 * own network ids. None of that is loss — the same program runs.</p>
 *
 * <p>What survives every one of those rewrites is the SET OF OPERANDS, so that is what this asserts. It catches
 * the whole measured loss class — a dropped unconsumed block, a jump's discarded condition spine, an FB instance
 * written with `typeName=""`, a flattened accessor — while staying blind to reformatting, which is the IDE's
 * business. Names introduced by `LET` are excluded: inlining them away is the canonicalizer doing its job.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is loose by design, and loose assertions rot into vacuous ones — which is how the graphical evidence in
 * this repo once stayed green over a body it was destroying. `test/unit/oracle.test.ts` pins the three measured
 * loss shapes it MUST refuse and the four measured rewrites it must accept, offline, so the looseness stays
