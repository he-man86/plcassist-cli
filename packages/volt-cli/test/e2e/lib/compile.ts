 * Assert the POU compiles — by asserting the WHOLE PROJECT builds with zero errors.

 * everything) the instantiate is a no-op and the build reaches it anyway.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>This assertion used to be vacuous, and about ten "and it compiles" tests rode on it.</b> It filtered the
 * build's diagnostics by the test-POU prefix — `JSON.stringify(d).includes(PREFIX)` — and NEITHER vendor puts an
 * item name in a diagnostic: the wire's diagnostic carries severity/message/line/column and nothing else, CODESYS
 * fills the message from raw compiler text (`Identifier 'Done' not defined` names no POU), and TwinCAT parses
 * `file(line,col) : error : text` and keeps only the text, discarding the file that carried the name. The filter
 * matched nothing, so `expect(0).toBe(0)` passed over exactly the errors each test existed to catch — including a
 * jump that did not compile at all (DIALECT C13).</p>
 *
 * <p>Zero-errors-project-wide is simpler AND stronger, and it is honest only because it was measured: with every
 * test POU removed, CodesysTestProject and TwinCAT Project14 each build 0 errors / 0 warnings. Any error is
 * therefore the POU under test or one an earlier test left behind, and failing loudly on the second is a feature.
 * If a fixture ever legitimately carries an error, snapshot the diagnostics first and assert the set does not
 * GROW — do not reintroduce a filter that can silently match nothing.</p>
